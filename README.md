# Marionette Boilerplate

I prefer the Sprockets asset compilation style to the one of RequireJS. Here is my implementation of that with Grunt.

### Setup
    npm install
    grunt compile


### For development
    grunt watch


### To compile assets:
    grunt compile


This will compile all the assets in to single files in the public directory.
